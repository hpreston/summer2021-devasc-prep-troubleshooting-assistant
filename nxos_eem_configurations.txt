! This file contains EEM configurations for this use case

! EEM Verification Examples: 
!   These EEM applets will monitor for the Syslog Events for the interface 
!   up/down and generate a Syslog Message. These are meant to verify that 
!   EEM is working, seperate from the Python Script.

! Monitor for "down"
event manager applet TS_Bot_Eth1_11_DOWN
  event syslog pattern "Interface Ethernet1/11 is down"
  action 1 syslog priority notifications msg SAW INTERFACE E1/11 GO DOWN

! Monitor for "up"
event manager applet TS_Bot_Eth1_11_UP
  event syslog pattern "Interface Ethernet1/11 is up"
  action 1 syslog priority notifications msg SAW INTERFACE E1/11 GO UP



! EEM Verification Examples: 
!   These EEM configurations will run the Python script that will 
!   run the show commands needed, and save their output to the 
!   bootflash on the switch.

! Monitor for "down"
event manager applet TS_Bot_Eth1_11_DOWN
  event syslog pattern "Interface Ethernet1/11 is down"
  action 1 cli python bootflash:troubleshooting_assistant.py --interface 1/11

! Monitor for "up"
